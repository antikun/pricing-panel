# pricing-panel

<h2>Description</h2>
A simple subscription plan panel with three options to choose from.

This small project was done as an exercise in Colt Steele's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Webdev Course on Udemy</a>.

<h2>Skills</h2>
The project is done at the end of the HTML/CSS section of the course and is aimed at putting together most of what has been learned so far such as basic styling of HTML elements (with imported fonts, colors, background colors, borders etc.), using flexbox and media queries to make the panel responsive, etc.

<h2>Results</h2>
Overall, I had fun doing this exercise. It turned out well, and I played with the :hover pseudo class and transition/transform properties to make it a bit more "interactive".
